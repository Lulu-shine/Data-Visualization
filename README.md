A & Z Beauty Store- Supplier evaluation analysis



Problem Statement.

This is an analysis of the supplier performance of AZ Beauty Store. The Data was cleaned by deleting errors and duplicates and adjusting font and column format for easy data analysis and visualization. AZ Beauty has 5 suppliers that produce beauty products such as Cosmetics, Hair care products, and Skin care products.
AZ runs a production volume of 39k distributed across five states in India, namely Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata. This is a descriptive and prescriptive analysis that answers the following subject matter.

*Who is the Top Performing Supplier in terms of cost competitiveness and volume of production/lead time?

*What product has the highest spend and lead time as against production volume?

*With economic fluctuations, how do I build a supplier chain network that is cost-effective while maintaining efficiency?

Steps followed:

Step 1: The File was uploaded as an Excel File to the Power BI Platform

Step 2: The File was imported into the Power Query editor, for Column format and name accuracy, duplicate and blank rows were deleted to organize the data for clarification

Step 3: The Dataset is divided into three parts, merged as one, namely Supply chain production, Sales, and Customer location, and Means of inward and outward transportation

Step 4: Column and Clustered bar chart was used to display Manufacturing cost and Lead time per supplier

Step 5: The second measure was used to create the calculation of Total Production cost per Supplier Dax: (Total Number of Production volume* Total Manufacturing cost)

Step 6:  Table array of average lead time, total product cost per product, and volume per product.

Step 7: For a holistic view, a slicer was used to display for each supplier.
